# SIR model based on diffusion

This repo contains the work for the final project for Introduction to Theoretical Physics, Spring 2022. In it you can find different simulations performed using a Diffusive model to replicate the propagation of a virus.

## Running the code
Please make sure you also have a `data` directory at the root of the project. If you cloned this repo you should be good to go :). Else, please run
```bash
mkdir data
```

Afterwards, you can run the program using

```bash
cd src
python3 main.py
```
 
## Branches

The different objectives worked on the project can be found in the various branches in this repo:

1. Running and validating the model: `master`
2. Replicating real-life data: `2nd-goal`
3. Variation of parameters to further understand the model: `3rd-goal`
4. Replicating real-life data that hasn't been studied before: `4th-goal`
5. Implementation of confinement: `4th-goal` and `JV/confinement`
